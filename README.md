# Motivational Quotes to Inspire - Web APP
## Introduction
X is a simple web application, created with React, that provides us with a random famous quote every time we press a button.
## Technologies
X is based on basic React, using a single component that collects data provided by a celebrity citations database API.
Every time the web application loads or the corresponding button is pressed, a fetch is made to the API that updates the status of the content and the author of the citation.
The application has been built from the create-react-app repository.
### Libraries
The following libraries have also been used:
* react-helmet
* font-awesome
* bootstrap
## Launching the APP
The application has been publicly deployed on surge.sh.
